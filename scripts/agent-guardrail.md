## Never crawl the filesystem for framework source

Your inline `find` is Claude Code's bundled **bfs** (multithreaded). A search
rooted at `/` (`find / …`, or a whole-disk `grep -r … /`) fans out across the
entire volume and pegs several cores for minutes (2026-07-09: three such scans
pinned a machine at load 30+ for 14 minutes) — and it is **never** the right way
to locate rune/keep internals. **Do not run inline `find` at all** — use
`fd <pattern> <scoped-dir>` / `rg` (or the Glob/Grep tools); if only real find
semantics work, `command find <scoped-dir> …` bypasses the bfs shim. Guarded
machines deny inline `find`/`bfs` and any scan rooted at `/` or `$HOME` via a
PreToolUse hook. And `| head -N` is NOT a cost bound: a pattern that can never
match scans the entire disk before head sees a single line. Everything agents
have historically crawled the disk for is already at hand:

- **The rune/keep contract** — `#assert`, `RuneAssertError`→HTTP 422, the
  `assert.string` / `.number` / `.boolean` / `.uint8Array` helpers,
  `RUNE_ASSERT=off`, the `// unvalidated:` cast rule, `bootstrapServer`,
  `@Endpoint`, `HttpException`, `getIdentity`, heal-rules — is documented in the
  skill references installed alongside you. Read them directly instead of
  hunting the source:
  - `~/.claude/skills/rune:spec/references/constraints.md` — the assert contract
    & seams
  - `~/.claude/skills/rune:framework/references/{endpoints,auth,deployment}.md`
    — runtime, bootstrap, auth, and error mapping
- **To resolve an import alias** (e.g. `#assert`): read the PROJECT's
  `deno.json` `imports` map — the alias is defined there and nowhere else. Never
  search for it.
- **The `#assert` call surface, in full** —
  `assert(SomeDto, value, "noun.verb context")` validates and returns the value
  (throws `RuneAssertError` on contract failure), plus `assert.string` /
  `assert.number` / `assert.boolean` / `assert.uint8Array` for primitive seams.
  That is the entire public API — never read the package source to "learn" it.
- **To find a cached/vendored dependency's real `.ts`:** run
  `deno info <specifier>` (e.g. `deno info jsr:@mrg-keystone/rune`) — it prints
  the exact cached path in milliseconds. If you must grep vendored source, scope
  the search to that path or to `~/Library/Caches/deno`, never `/`. Searching
  the filesystem for a package BY NAME can never work: Deno 2 stores JSR modules
  under sha256-hashed filenames, so no path contains the package name.
- **Playwright screenshots / console logs** land in
  `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright-mcp/` and the project's `.playwright-mcp/` —
  look there, don't crawl for the file.

If something genuinely isn't in the project or the caches above, say so and ask
— do not escalate to a root-wide `find`.
